## About Us

Domain Driven Design Taiwan Community (DDDTW) is a community formed by enthusiasts of domain-driven design. We primarily focus on exploring the true business needs and problems to be solved from a business perspective. Through a series of cross-organizational collaborations and stakeholder communications, we design solutions that meet the requirements and create value.

Founded in 2018, we are passionate about sharing, technology, and learning. Our volunteers include software engineers, architects, product managers, designers, and various partners who love domain-driven design. Our Facebook community has nearly 4,500 members and continues to grow.

Since our inception, we have accumulated extensive experience in both online and offline activities. These include book clubs, meetup presentations, workshops, and even hackathons. In 2020 and 2021, we organized the first and second Domain Driven Design Conference. In addition to inviting industry professionals to share their expertise, we also collaborate regularly with various communities, accumulating a wealth of practical experience in development.
