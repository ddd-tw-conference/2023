# About

Domain Driven Design Taiwan Community (DDDTW) is a community formed by enthusiasts of domain-driven design. We focus on understanding the true business needs and problems from a business perspective. By collaborating across organizations and engaging with stakeholders, we design solutions that meet requirements and create value.

**Passionate about sharing, technology, and learning**, DDDTW was founded in 2018. Our community comprises software engineers, architects, product managers, designers, and domain-driven design enthusiasts. We have nearly 4,500 members on our **growing Facebook community**.

Throughout our journey, we have gained extensive experience through both online and offline activities. These include book clubs, meetup presentations, workshops, and even hackathons. In 2020 and 2021, we successfully organized the first and second **Domain Driven Design Conference**, where industry professionals shared their expertise. We also collaborate regularly with other communities, enriching our practical development experience.

Join us in exploring the world of domain-driven design and solving real business challenges!
