Exploring how to utilize event storming to identify key business event flows and content, and to pinpoint and establish metrics and event traces that have a tangible impact on business operations. This discussion will also touch on the basic components and concepts of observability.

Initially, Event Storming is a method for modeling and visualizing brainstorming, aiming to embed the understanding of events into business models. This means that when understanding and discussing business requirements, we actively seek and define a series of ""events"". These ""events"" are pivotal activities in the system and will leave behind ""records"" or ""logs"".

Following this, in modern system architectures (like containerization and Serverless), as we lean into the log concept of the 12-Factor App, we'll gain a deeper grasp of the role of events in systems. In this structure, events (or logs) are not merely static records but represent a dynamic data flow, reflecting the state of the system at specific moments.

Subsequently, this idea leads us to observability engineering. Here, logs (or events) are just one of the means we employ to understand and enhance system behavior. Beyond logs, metrics and traces are vital data sources that give us a comprehensive insight into the system. The practice of observability engineering aims to centralize and leverage this data, allowing us to pinpoint and address issues in live systems.

Lastly, OpenTelemetry is a tool that brings observability engineering to life by integrating logs, metrics, and traces. This offers a unified and holistic view of our system. This comprehensive approach enables a better understanding of how events (documented in logs) influence our system, providing strategies for performance improvement.

Through the above exploration, a progression and deepening relationship can be seen among Event Storming, the log concept of the 12-Factor App, observability engineering, and OpenTelemetry. All these themes revolve around a central issue: how can we better understand and improve our systems."
