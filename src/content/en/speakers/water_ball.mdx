"Hi, I'm Water Ball. I am the founder of Shuiqiu Software Co., Ltd., Shuiqiu Software Academy community, and a core volunteer of the Taiwan Domain-Driven Design community.

1. My major is Software Design, Software Architecture, and Software Engineering. Most people know me from my YouTube channel, where I share insights on ""Design Patterns."" I love sharing my knowledge online and enjoy explaining complex software design concepts in a way that is enjoyable and entertaining for everyone. This has helped shape a unified perception of ""software design"" during my interactions with others.

2. Last year, fueled by my passion for software, I founded Shuiqiu Software Academy, which now has over six thousand members leading fulfilling and exciting lives. Since its inception, I have been consistently sharing knowledge on ""software design"" within the academy and have organized more than 70 events related to software design and engineering, with an average participation of 93 people.

3. This year marks the second half of my entrepreneurial journey, and my company's goal is to develop a unique ""online course platform"" that rekindles the true purpose of learning: ""Learning not driven by anxiety but by the desire to explore, to see more of the world, and to progress together with friends."" In my upcoming talk, I will also discuss how I leveraged Domain-Driven Design principles to effectively lead our product development journey.

4. Transforming complex, intertwined knowledge, stories, and spirit into delectable dishes that move people is my passion and expertise. If you'd like to embark on a 45-minute journey of software engineering enlightenment, I welcome you to listen to my speech."
