Wesley Chiu (邱凡遠) is a Product Manager at Tanzu Labs. He transitioned from the cybersecurity profession to become a software engineer while in the US Air Force (USAF), hoping to replace its archaic and painful tools that his fellow service members relied on for missions from small drone detection & defense to space operations planning & execution. He later found his greatest passion in product management and led several grassroots movements across the USAF from Boston to San Francisco to transform how it delivers software to solve critical national security problems across the globe. He also cycles and rock climbs obsessively, dabbles in sports & portrait photography, and hacks IoT devices for fun.
