    <meta name="description" content="Domain-Driven Design (DDD) is really good at understanding business domains, but alone it does not fully enable organizations to continually meet the changing software needs of tomorrow. This talk will showcase how we combine DDD with other agile practices like User-Centered Design (UCD) and Balanced Teams to achieve two things: (1) an evolutionary architecture that supports guided and incremental change, and (2) A team that continuously discovers and delivers outcomes at speed in an increasingly ambiguous world. We will cover case studies, statistical evidence, and anecdotal experiences that show how these practices help your team and business go fast, forever. Finally, you’ll take away tactics for you and your team to grow and nurture these practices within your organization.">
